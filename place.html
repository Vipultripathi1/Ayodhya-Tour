Translating to Ram's Birthplace, the Ram Janmabhoomi is believed to have been the birthplace of the Hindu deity, Lord Ram. According to the Indian epic Ramayan, Ram, Lord Vishnu's seventh manifestation, is said to have grown up along Ayodhya's river Sarayu. The Ram Janmabhoomi is a highly revered site for Hindu devotees.
After being a conflicted site for decades, the Ram Janmabhoomi land was handed over to a trust by the Supreme Court of India to build the Ram Temple. The groundbreaking ceremony for laying of the foundation stone for the Ram Temple of Ayodhya was performed on 5 August 2020 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The proposed design of the temple is grand and magnificent.
The Ram Janmabhoomi site is where the famous Babri Masjid once stood. It is believed that the Mughals demolished a Hindu shrine to built this mosque at the birthplace of Lord Ram. In 1992, a group of Hindu nationalists tore down the Babri Masjid which led to a series of violent riot across India. In October 2019, a bench of five judges of the Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Ram Temple. An alternate 5 acres of land was also given to the Sunni Waqf Board to built a mosque.</p>

Housed within the panoramic view of the surrounding hills is a 6-inch-tall idol of Hanuman. The main temple has an interior cave adorned with the numerous statues of Lord Hanuman along with his mother, Maa Anjani. Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti, which celebrate the birth of Lord Ram and Lord Hanuman respectively, attract thousands of devotees to the Hanuman Garhi.</p>

The Kanak Bhawan is established towards the northeastern corner of the Ram Janmabhoomi in Tulsi Nagar. Constructed in 1891, this temple is also known as Sone-ka-Ghar. It is a holy site dedicated to the Hindu deity Lord Rama and his wife, Goddess Sita.
Kanak Bhawan, also meaning Golden Palace, cites three golden-crowned idols of the two gods under a silver roof in the sanctum santorum (Garbagriha). It is believed that this shrine was gifted to Rama and Sita by the former's stepmother, Kaikeyi. 
Upon designed renovation during Vikramaditya's reign, the present site was further entirely revamped by Vrish Bhanu Kunwari. This Bundela-styled temple is currently managed by the Sri Vrishbhan Dharma Setu Trust Private Limited</p>

Established in the name of the local deity, Lord Nageshwarnath, the Nageshwarnath Temple is located adjacent to the Theri Bazaar in Ayodhya. It is believed to have been set up by Kush or Kusha, Lord Rama's son.
Although this sacred site continued to be in good maintenance since 750 AD, the current temple is said to have been reconstructed in 1750 by Safar Jung's minister, Naval Rai. Legend has it that Kush came across a Shiva devotee called Naga Kanya when he happened to lose his arm ring in the local bath.
Upon learning that the latter had fallen in love with him, he raised this Shaiva temple for Naga Kanya. The Nageshwarnath Temple attracts numerous devotees during Mahashivaratri and Trayodashi, also known as Pradosh Vrat or Pradosh Vratam, in Southern India. The Shiva Barat or the procession of Lord Shiva is a significant attraction here.
